## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

<b>Crop-Doctor</b> is a Progrssive Web APP (PWA) designed for automated plant disease detection and proposal of method for the prevention and cure of the disease. This app will help farmers to detect the diseases and how can they overcome it. It will also generate a detail report which will contain the disease names in number of species. If required, they can also verify it by the government authorities who will verify the report generated and will help with the input if required. The collected data will help our system to predict the diseases in more accurate way due to self-learning mechanism. The system will be easy to use with some basics functionalities which will make it user friendly for farmers.

## 1.1 Problem Definition

To develop an **App-Based solution** to identify & solve disease in plants/crops and also provide additional features such as teleconsulting to help farmers to overcome the difficulties in farming thus increasing the economic yeild.

## 1.2 Scope of the Project

The project outcome is a **Progressive Web Application** that will provide a **platform to the farmers, to monitor their plants health and provide appropriate insights  and alerts regarding crop diseases**. In addition to these primary features it should also teleconsulting features.

## 1.3 Features of the Project
1. 'Crop Doctor', a fully responsive and automated plant disease detection Progressive Web Application (PWA)
2. Farmers need to upload a photo of the suspected diseased crop to our servers. A detailed report will be generated which will detect the presence of crop disease, predict the type of disease, and will also provide solutions for the same.
3. If required, farmers can verify the disease report from experts using our app's Teleconsulting feature.
4. Text to speech feature for farmers.
5. The collected data will help our system detect and predict plant/crop diseases with increasing accuracy by way of its self-learning and continuous improvement mechanism.

The key features of the project are: 
<ol type="i">
 <li>Language selection option (Indian regional languages)</li>
 <li>Tracking of IP addresses to detect possible outbreaks and issuing alerts for the same</li>
 <li>Prediction of upcoming outbreaks (over time, via self-learning)</li>
 <li>A statistics dashboard with analytics</li>
 <li>A community forum for farmers</li>
 <li>A chatbot for personal communication (alerts, updates, etc.)</li>
</ol>
